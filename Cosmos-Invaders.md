# Cosmos Invaders

## Main Idea

### Learn-to-Earn or Gamers - Projects: Win - Win

The Cosmos Invaders game will unite the interests of players with the interests of projects from the Cosmos Ecosystem:
- Players want to have a good time, and at the same time gain new knowledge, as well as rewards
- Projects are interested in popularizing their idea, explaining their functionality, and of course, real users

The Cosmos Invaders game gamifies the learning process and will give players an idea of what staking, liquid staking, liquidity pools and farming are in a game form!

People have a poor understanding of how DeFi works.

“Send Token-A with Token-B to the Liquidity Pool and you will receive PL tokens that you can hold to receive Token-B, which you can exchange for other tokens!” is an accurate description of the pharming process (liquidity mining) , but does not provide any real understanding.
We decided to correct this shortcoming and came up with a simple game explanation:

“Send Uranium and Plutonium to the Energy Generator, and the Generator will produce Electricity! With the help of Electricity, you can charge the Batteries! You can exchange charged Batteries for other resources!” - this explanation will be clear to almost everyone!
On the back end, $ATOM will play the role of Uranium, $JUNO will play the role of Plutonium, and the ATOM/JUNO Liquidity Pool will act as the Energy Generator.

The electricity that the Generator produces will be the LP token of the ATOM/JUNO pool!

Charging the Batteries with Electricity means sending ATOM/JUNO LP tokens to farming, and receiving Charged Batteries means receiving $OSMO as a reward for Farming!

Trading Charged Batteries for other resources means exchanging $OSMO for other coins that are traded on Osmosis.

On the back end everything is quite boring and unclear. And on the Front End - this is an interesting and exciting game that even a child will understand!

In fact, the back-end of Cosmos Invaders is already ready!

The back-end of Cosmos Invaders is the Cosmos Ecosystem!

All we have left to do is the Front End and a few smart contracts that will simplify the gameplay.

Every blockchain in the Cosmos Ecosystem is a Galaxy!

Each blockchain in the Cosmos Ecosystem is connected to other blockchains through IBC-relayers.

It is through these channels that Players will send their NFT Spaceships from one Galaxy to Another to form clans and trade, or fight with each other!

The gamification of liquid staking will make it possible to build your bases on other blockchains, for example Ethereum!

DeFi will stop being boring! DeFi is about to get interesting! DeFi will become GameFi!

## Implementation

### All we need to implement Cosmos Invaders is to combine what we already have and package it up beautifully!

Here's what we already have:
- The Cosmos ecosystem - many sovereign blockchains that are connected to each other by IBC relays - will be the Cosmos Invaders Playing Field!
- Validators that support IBC relays will be our portals for moving around the Game Field!
- Many Dex with huge Liquidity Pools, and the possibility of farming (liquidity mining), as well as Super-Fluid Staking, will be our Space Trade Ports, and Maintenance Stations for the Spaceships of our Players
- Many Liquid Staking projects will be used to build Space Bases on blockchains outside the Cosmos Ecosystem
- Many NFT projects will become our Space Ports for the acquisition and exchange of Spaceships
- Privacy projects - will be an interesting addition to the game for sending encrypted signals
- Decentralized data storage projects will become our game servers

What we are missing and how we will get it:
- Players will be attracted both from existing users of the Cosmos Ecosystem and from outside it, including from outside the crypto environment
- Front-end, smart contracts, UI/UX, as well as a mobile application on iOS and Android will be created by developers and designers
- Starting capital for Players to complete and pay for transactions will be provided at the expense of the Space Ecosystem Projects and Investors

Steps for implementation (from what we want to get to what we already have):
- As a result, we want to get a Game in which players will travel on Spaceships throughout the Cosmos Ecosystem, improve their Ships, trade with each other, fight, and build their bases.
- For this, Front-end, UX/UI, smart contracts, mobile application must be implemented
- All this must be tested for safety
- To do this, you need to create a test version of the game
- To do this, you need to create a test Front-end, UX/UI, smart contracts, mobile application
- To do this, documentation must be described, flowcharts must be created, variables and their interactions must be described.
- To do this you need to call!

## Game Parts

- Players - living people or digital entities
- Game Field - Space Ecosystem
- Portals - IBC-Relays
- Spaceship - InterChain NFT with the ability to update data within the NFT
- Resources - coins of Space Ecosystem projects
- Ship Components (for example, Cargo Bay, Energy Generator) - smart contracts associated with Liquidity Pools on the Dex of the Cosmos Ecosystem: Osmosis, JunoSwap, SifChain Dex, Crescent, Cyber
- Space Base - smart contracts associated with Liquidity Pools on Dexes outside the Space Ecosystem: Persistence, Umee, EVMOS
- Space Port - a place to purchase or exchange Spaceships - OmniFlix, Stargaze, AssetMantl, Aura Network
- Trading Ports - Space Ecosystem Dex: Osmosis, JunoSwap, SifChain Dex, Crescent, Cyber
- Maintenance Stations for ship upgrades: DEXes + NFT projects

##  Game Process

- The player connects to the game interface via Keplr
- The player is offered to undergo training, during which he will be introduced to the functionality of the Game
- The player receives the simplest NFT Ship that costs nothing
- The player can go to the Quest Center to select a Quest to complete
- For completing a task, the Player receives a Reward and a mark on the completed Task
- The more completed tasks the Player has, the more difficult Tasks the Player can choose
- The more difficult the task, the greater the reward for completing the task
- Tasks can be created both by projects from the Cosmos Ecosystem and by other Players
- The one who creates the Task must send funds to the smart contract for a reward for completing the Task
- The execution of Tasks may be associated with third-party web2 resources, such as Twitter. For example: On the Front End, the player needs to attach his Twitter account to the game account, take the Task “Transmit important data for the inhabitants of the Space Colony”, fly on a Spaceship to the Space Colony, and transfer the data there, then confirm the completion of the Task and receive a Reward.
- On the Back End - The player copies the text, pastes it into the post, and tweets on behalf of his account. The bot checks the Player’s tweet; if the tweet is made, the smart contract sends the Reward for the Task to the Player’s address.
- The player can use the Reward for exchange at the Trading Port, or to improve the ship at the Maintenance Station
- The player can trade with other players - p2p exchange
- The player can put his Spaceship up for sale
- The Player can enter into battle with other Players - to do this, the Player must place a bet. After this, players play an arcade game - the winner takes the other players' bets
- The player can go explore the Cosmos Ecosystem - complete Quiz from projects, answer questions about projects, learn more about the projects of the Cosmos Ecosystem, and receive an NFT for this to improve his ship (change the appearance of the Ship)
- The player can build his own Base, independently or in a team with other Players
- The base brings Resources that can be used in the gameplay

## Why won't the Gameplay end?
1) The gaming process involves the player’s participation in staking, liquid staking, replenishing liquidity pools, etc. Players will receive real rewards for their actions, which do not require additional incentives from the outside. Players will do the same thing that users of the Cosmos Ecosystem do, only in a game form. That is, the Game will not end for the same reasons that staking and DeFi do not end.
2) The Space ecosystem is constantly growing, new projects are appearing. These projects are interested in real users and disseminating information about themselves. Projects can use the Game as a tool for Digital Marketing:
- Create Tasks with rewards for completion
- Make airdrops on players
- Create Quiz for Players who explore the Cosmos Ecosystem
3) The Game will have built-in mini-games with various game mechanics, such as Snake, Taur-Defense, Space Invaders, Arkanoid, etc. - such games have not ceased to lose popularity for many years, and they will complement the gameplay at times when Players need to wait for new tasks to appear
