# Cosmos Invaders(Name to Change)

## Main Idea

### Learn-to-Earn for Gamers - Win-Win Projects

The Cosmos Invaders game aims to align the interests of players with those of projects within the Cosmos Ecosystem:

- Players seek enjoyment and the opportunity to gain new knowledge and rewards.
- Projects aim to popularize their ideas, explain their functionality, and attract real users.

Cosmos Invaders gamifies the learning process, providing players with insights into staking, liquid staking, liquidity pools, and farming in a gaming format.

DeFi concepts are often poorly understood. For instance, describing the process of liquidity mining as "Send Token-A with Token-B to the Liquidity Pool and you will receive PL tokens that you can hold to receive Token-B, which you can exchange for other tokens!" is accurate but lacks clarity.

To address this, we've developed a simple game explanation:

"Send Uranium and Plutonium to the Energy Generator, and the Generator will produce Electricity! With Electricity, you can charge the Batteries! You can exchange charged Batteries for other resources!" This explanation is designed to be easily understood by almost everyone.

Behind the scenes, $ATOM represents Uranium, $JUNO represents Plutonium, and the ATOM/JUNO Liquidity Pool serves as the Energy Generator. The electricity generated by the Generator becomes the LP token of the ATOM/JUNO pool.

Charging Batteries with Electricity involves sending ATOM/JUNO LP tokens to farming, and receiving Charged Batteries means earning $OSMO as a reward for Farming. Trading Charged Batteries for other resources means exchanging $OSMO for other coins traded on Osmosis.

While the backend is complex, the frontend of Cosmos Invaders offers an engaging and easy-to-understand game.

In reality, the backend of Cosmos Invaders is the Cosmos Ecosystem itself.

All that remains is to develop the frontend and a few smart contracts to streamline gameplay.

Every blockchain in the Cosmos Ecosystem is a Galaxy. These blockchains are interconnected through IBC relayers, enabling players to send their NFT Spaceships from one Galaxy to another, form clans, trade, or engage in battles.

The gamification of liquid staking will allow players to establish bases on other blockchains, such as Ethereum, making DeFi more exciting and transforming it into GameFi.

## Implementation

### To implement Cosmos Invaders, we need to consolidate and package what we already have.

What we have:

- The Cosmos ecosystem comprises numerous sovereign blockchains connected through IBC relays, forming the Cosmos Invaders Playing Field.
- Validators supporting IBC relays serve as our portals for navigating the Game Field.
- Multiple DEXs with extensive Liquidity Pools, liquidity mining opportunities, and Super-Fluid Staking function as our Space Trade Ports and Maintenance Stations for player Spaceships.
- Various Liquid Staking projects will be used to construct Space Bases on blockchains outside the Cosmos Ecosystem.
- Numerous NFT projects will serve as our Space Ports for acquiring and exchanging Spaceships.
- Privacy projects will add an interesting dimension to the game, enabling encrypted signal transmissions.
- Decentralized data storage projects will function as our game servers.

What's needed and how we'll obtain it:

- Players will be attracted from existing users of the Cosmos Ecosystem and beyond, including those outside the crypto community.
- Developers and designers will create the frontend, smart contracts, UI/UX, and a mobile application for iOS and Android.
- Initial capital for players to complete transactions will be provided by Space Ecosystem Projects and Investors.

Implementation steps (from concept to completion):

- Ultimately, we aim to create a game where players traverse the Cosmos Ecosystem on Spaceships, upgrade their ships, trade, battle, and build bases.
- To achieve this, we must implement the frontend, UX/UI, smart contracts, and mobile application.
- All components must undergo rigorous safety testing.
- To facilitate testing, a trial version of the game must be developed.
- This requires creating a test frontend, UX/UI, smart contracts, and mobile application.
- Detailed documentation, flowcharts, and descriptions of variables and their interactions are essential.
- Finally, we must make the call!

## Game Process

- Players connect to the game interface via Keplr.
- Players are offered training to familiarize themselves with the game's functionality.
- Players receive a basic NFT Ship at no cost.
- Players can visit the Quest Center to select and complete tasks.
- Completing tasks earns players rewards and marks for completed tasks.
- More completed tasks unlock access to more challenging ones with greater rewards.
- Tasks can be created by projects within the Cosmos Ecosystem or other players.
- Task creators must provide funds to the smart contract as rewards.
- Task execution may involve third-party web2 resources, such as Twitter, to complete certain objectives.
- Players can use their rewards for exchanges at the Trading Port or to upgrade their ships at Maintenance Stations.
- Players can engage in peer-to-peer trading, put their Spaceships up for sale, or enter battles with other players.
- Battles require players to place bets, and the winner takes the bets of other players.
- Players can explore the Cosmos Ecosystem, completing quizzes, answering questions about projects, and earning NFTs to enhance their ships' appearance.
- Players can independently or collaboratively build their own Bases, which generate resources for gameplay.

## Why the Gameplay Won't End

1. The gameplay involves player participation in staking, liquid staking, and liquidity pool management, offering real rewards without external incentives. Players will engage in activities akin to Cosmos Ecosystem users, making the game enduring, much like staking and DeFi.
2. The Space ecosystem is continuously expanding with new projects. These projects seek real users and use the game as a digital marketing tool by creating rewarding tasks, conducting airdrops, and organizing quizzes.
3. The game will feature built-in mini-games with various mechanics (e.g., Snake, Taur-Defense, Space Invaders, Arkanoid), providing entertainment during downtimes when players await new tasks.


## Summary 

Cosmos Invaders is an innovative blockchain-based game that combines decentralized finance (DeFi) with gaming. The core idea behind Cosmos Invaders is to bridge the gap between DeFi concepts and mainstream gaming by making complex financial concepts accessible and engaging for players. In this game, players interact with elements like Uranium and Plutonium, which power an "Energy Generator" to produce electricity. This electricity is then converted into Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens, which can be used for farming and earning rewards, adding an educational twist to the DeFi experience.

The game's ecosystem comprises various components, including NFT Spaceships, Portals (IBC-Relays) that connect different blockchains, smart contracts for ship components, space bases, and space ports, privacy projects, and decentralized data storage. These elements combine to create a dynamic gaming environment where players can explore, trade, complete quests, and even engage in battles with other players. To enhance engagement, the game includes built-in mini-games such as Snake, Taur-Defense, Space Invaders, and Arkanoid, offering entertainment during downtime.

Cosmos Invaders is designed to be accessible to both existing users of the Cosmos Ecosystem and newcomers to the world of cryptocurrencies and DeFi. Players can access the game via Keplr, undergo training, and start with a basic NFT Ship. They can then choose quests to complete, unlocking more challenging tasks and greater rewards as they progress. These tasks can be created by projects within the Cosmos Ecosystem or other players, introducing a competitive and rewarding aspect to the game.

The game's longevity is ensured by its alignment with real DeFi activities, as players engage in staking, liquid staking, and liquidity pool management, earning tangible rewards for their efforts. Furthermore, the Space Ecosystem is continuously evolving, with new projects leveraging the game for digital marketing and user acquisition. As a result, Cosmos Invaders promises to transform the often complex and abstract world of DeFi into an exciting and educational gaming experience, making DeFi concepts more approachable to a broader audience while providing projects with a unique avenue for user engagement and promotion.
