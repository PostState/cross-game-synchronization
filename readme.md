# Cross Game Synchronization

## What is this?


Cross-Game Synchronization (CGS) is a combination of completely different (separate) games that can exchange data with each other.

The games that are included in the CGS are created on the blockchain, and if one blockchain is able to transfer data to another blockchain, then a game created on one blockchain is able to transfer data to a game created on another blockchain.

Classic games are hosted either on a personal computer or on a server, and all data about the player, his characters, artifacts, and achievements is also stored either on a personal computer or on a server.
The player gets access to his character and achievements in the game through his account, usually by entering his username and password.
If the game account data is deleted from the computer or server, the player will also lose access to his character and game achievements.
Data from one game cannot be transferred to another game, since classic games are limited by the code and game engine in which they are written.
In other words, I can't transfer a tank from World of Tanks to World of Warcraft.

In the case of blockchain games, all data about the player, his characters, artifacts and game achievements are stored on the player's address in the blockchain, and cannot be deleted, changed or lost.
The player's address in the blockchain is the game account, and the player accesses his account using an e-wallet.
Data about the player, his characters, artifacts and game achievements are stored on the player's address in the NFT form, and thanks to smart contracts and interoperable blockchains, they can be transferred from one account (address) to another account, or from one blockchain to another blockchain (from one game to another game).

Example:
We have Fantasy RPG on one blockchain and Space Strategy on another blockchain.
The player, using an e-wallet, connects to the Fantasy RPG, and during the game he finds a powerful artifact, for example, this is the Wizard's Hat.
In the blockchain, this is displayed as a record that the player's address contains an NFT with a unique hash (number).
The Fantasy RPG interface accesses the player's address, detects that the address contains an NFT with a unique number, and displays this data as the Wizard's Hat.
The player logs out of the Fantasy RPG and uses the same e-wallet to connect to Space Strategy on another blockchain.
The Space Strategy interface accesses the player's address, detects that the address contains an NFT with a unique number, and displays it as a Spaceship Laser Launcher.

Cross-Game Synchronization is an agreement between completely different games (in different styles and genres, use completely different game engines that can be made both on the same and on different blockchains) about how one game will display and use in game mechanics NFT that the player received in another game.

In a nutshell: Cross-Game Sync deals with syncing data from different games!


## What does it give the player?

### CGS opens up a huge number of new opportunities for the player, which could not even be thought of before!

- The player needs only one game account (address) to connect to all the games that are included in the CGS. The player can switch between games in one click, at any time!
- All data about the gameplay and achievements of the player cannot be lost or faked!
- The player's achievements in one game also earn the player achievements in other games! If a player is tired of playing a shooter, then he can switch to strategy or RPG, and at the same time he will immediately have achievements in them!
- Now the player can not only purchase crystals, skins and artifacts to speed up the development in the game, but can also sell them back!
- The player can easily share their skins, artifacts and achievements with other players!
- Each player knows exactly (and can check it) how rare their artifacts are, how many there are, and which players they belong to!
- The value of each character, artifact, skin or player achievement increases with each new game that joins the CGS, as all characters, artifacts, skins and achievements can be used in new games!
- When joining a new game to the CGS, all existing players receive tokens and NFT from the new game, which can be used not only in the new game, but also in all games that were already included in the CGS


## What does this give the project (game)?

- CGS is a real “game changer”! CGS is the killer of Steam!
- The project (Game) does not need to think about where to find players! A project that joins the CGS immediately receives a huge number of players from all the games that are included in the CGS
- The project (Game) does not have to pay for advertising! All the project needs to do is drop in-game tokens and/or in-game NFTs to existing players!
- The project (Game) receives the support of developers and testers at the phase of synchronization with CGS
- The Project (Game) independently makes decisions about how characters, artifacts, and game achievements from other games will be implemented in their game
- The value of each Project (Game) increases with each new Project (Game) that joins the CGS
- The project does not have to pay anything for joining CGS!

## What does this give developers?

CGS greatly simplifies the development process, giving developers a steady income!

- Each developer (or group of developers) receives income from every interaction with their open source software! The more Games are included in the CGS, and the more players play games, the more developers earn! Developers will receive income for their work as long as their work is used!
- Once-working code no longer needs to be fixed! All software code (all smart contracts) of developers are first tested in the test network of the CGS, and after the developers are completely confident in their reliability and performance, their program code is implemented in the main network of the CGS
- The emergence of new games, as well as new game mechanics, will require additional smart contracts, which will enable developers to increase their regular income!
 
## Who has already joined?


Already now, at the preliminary agreement stage, Metarchy, Cosmos Chicken Coop, HoneyWood have joined CGS. Games on the Cosmos and Massa blockchain.

Metarchy is an open-source online game based on Cosmos SDK and coded on Massa Network, with autonomous smart contracts; microeconomics, opponent prediction, and outcome betting. Players can participate in championships and choose sponsors themselves.

Cosmos Chicken Coop is a fantastic, fun, engaging, and secure way to learn the world of crypto. This is primarily a game and at the same time a whole platform for management. Here you will enjoy playing and managing your coins, which are necessary for the development and security of the entire post-world. The game is developed on the best modern blockchain - Cosmos! You will find here Easter Eggs of the Cosmos Ecosystem! By playing the game you will learn the basic mechanics of modern blockchain technologies - staking, governance, voting, making decisions, and decentralization!

HoneyWood is a Play-and-Earn game, which rewards players for their activities. In HoneyWood players can build and fight in PVE and PVP battles.
