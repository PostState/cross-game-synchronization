# Cross-Game Synchronization (CGS): Enhancing Cross-Game Data Exchange

## What is CGS?
Cross-Game Synchronization (CGS) is a revolutionary concept that amalgamates distinct games, enabling them to seamlessly exchange data.

CGS encompasses games developed on blockchain technology. When one blockchain can share data with another, games on one blockchain can transfer data to those on another blockchain.

Traditional games are typically hosted on personal computers or servers, where player data, including characters, artifacts, and achievements, is stored. Access to in-game assets and accomplishments is usually granted through a player's account, typically authenticated via a username and password. If the game account data is deleted from the computer or server, the player loses access to their character and in-game achievements. Classic games are constrained by the code and game engine in which they are built, preventing the transfer of assets from one game to another. In other words, you cannot transfer a tank from World of Tanks to World of Warcraft.

In contrast, blockchain games store all player data, including characters, artifacts, and game achievements, on the player's blockchain address in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This data is immutable, unchangeable, and can't be lost. Players access their accounts using e-wallets. Thanks to smart contracts and interoperable blockchains, these assets can be transferred from one account (address) to another or from one blockchain to another, effectively allowing players to move assets from one game to another.

**Example:** Consider Fantasy RPG on one blockchain and Space Strategy on another. A player, using an e-wallet, connects to Fantasy RPG and discovers a powerful artifact, such as the Wizard's Hat. In the blockchain, this is represented as a record within the player's address, containing a unique NFT hash. Fantasy RPG's interface detects this NFT, displaying it as the Wizard's Hat. Later, when the player switches to Space Strategy using the same e-wallet, the Space Strategy interface recognizes the NFT and displays it as a Spaceship Laser Launcher.

In essence, Cross-Game Synchronization is an agreement among entirely different games, regardless of style, genre, or game engine, defining how one game will incorporate NFTs obtained in other games into its mechanics.

**In a nutshell:** Cross-Game Sync deals with synchronizing data across diverse games!

## What Does It Offer Players?
CGS introduces a multitude of unprecedented opportunities for players:

1. **Single Game Account:** Players need only one game account (address) to access all games within CGS. Switching between games is effortless and instantaneous.

2. **Data Security:** All gameplay and achievement data are safeguarded, preventing loss or tampering.

3. **Universal Achievements:** Achievements earned in one game contribute to a player's progress in other games.

4. **Asset Trading:** Players can buy and sell crystals, skins, and artifacts, enhancing the in-game experience.

5. **Asset Sharing:** Players can easily share their skins, artifacts, and achievements with others.

6. **Transparency:** Players can verify the rarity, quantity, and ownership of their artifacts.

7. **Value Expansion:** The value of characters, artifacts, skins, and player achievements grows with each new game integrated into CGS.

8. **Bonuses:** Upon joining CGS, existing players receive tokens and NFTs from the new game, usable across all CGS games.

## What Does It Offer Projects (Games)?
CGS is a game-changer for projects/games:

1. **Increased Player Base:** CGS instantly provides access to a vast player pool from all participating games.

2. **Minimal Advertising Costs:** Projects need only distribute in-game tokens and NFTs to existing players, eliminating the need for extensive advertising.

3. **Development Support:** Projects receive developer and tester support during the synchronization phase with CGS.

4. **Autonomy:** Projects can independently decide how to implement characters, artifacts, and game achievements from other games into their own.

5. **Increased Value:** Each project's value grows with every new project that joins CGS.

6. **No Entry Costs:** Projects can join CGS without incurring any fees.

## What Does It Offer Developers?
Developers benefit significantly from CGS:

1. **Streamlined Development:** CGS simplifies the development process, ensuring a consistent income for developers.

2. **Ongoing Income:** Developers earn income from every interaction with their open-source software, with earnings increasing as more games and players participate.

3. **Code Reliability:** All software code (smart contracts) is rigorously tested in the CGS test network before being implemented in the main network.

4. **Expansion Opportunities:** The introduction of new games and mechanics necessitates additional smart contracts, enabling developers to increase their regular income.

## Who Has Already Joined CGS?
Even at the preliminary agreement stage, several projects have joined CGS, including Metarchy, Cosmos Chicken Coop, and HoneyWood, all on the Cosmos and Massa blockchains.

- **Metarchy** is an open-source online game based on Cosmos SDK, coded on Massa Network, featuring autonomous smart contracts, microeconomics, opponent prediction, and outcome betting. Players can participate in championships and choose their own sponsors.

- **Cosmos Chicken Coop** offers a fun, engaging, and secure way to explore the world of crypto. This game doubles as a platform for management, allowing players to enjoy both gameplay and coin management, essential for post-world development. The game is developed on the Cosmos blockchain, featuring Easter Eggs from the Cosmos Ecosystem and teaching players the basics of blockchain technology.

- **HoneyWood** is a Play-and-Earn game, rewarding players for their activities. In HoneyWood, players can build and engage in both PVE and PVP battles.

- **Cosmic Horizon: Dominions** is a groundbreaking space trading hybrid game developed by Qwoyn Studios within the Cosmos ecosystem. It seamlessly combines elements from multiple genres, including strategy games, MMORPGs, and real-time shooters, offering players a vast interconnected virtual universe to explore, engage with, and shape.
